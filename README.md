# Depression-prediction
In public health, understanding the nature of depression as a mental health disorder stands as a pressing challenge warranting comprehensive research and policy attention (Johnson & Johnson, 2019). Recognized globally for its negative impact on people’s well-being and economic productivity (World Health Organization, 2020), depression has become a focus of various health studies and interventions. The WHO states that over 280 million people worldwide have depression and acknowledges that various lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, healthy eating habits, alcohol abuse, and related factors have an influence on its onset and progression (WHO, 2020).

This is a comprehensive analysis of the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset for the year 2015, targeting key patterns and insights into depression. The research is driven by a need to understand depression's underlying factors and its distribution across various demographics and lifestyle choices. Specifically, the aims are to:

Identify critical risk factors associated with depression, including other chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and demographic variables.
Investigate state variations in depression prevalence, determining if certain regions exhibit higher rates.
Develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of depression based on diverse risk factors.
These objectives are aligned with the broader goal of informing targeted interventions and policy decisions that can effectively address the growing concerns surrounding mental health and depression. The study's approach offers a unique perspective by leveraging a large-scale dataset to uncover patterns that might otherwise remain obscured in smaller studies.

The BRFSS is compiled through a national survey, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015), with over 400,000 interviews each year –the largest ongoing adult health survey system in the world. This survey system provides insights capable of contributing to a deeper understanding of demographic and behavioural determinants (Smith et al., 2017).

The analysis starts with data preparation and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis to summarize and visualize key variables. A detailed statistical analysis, including modelling and the application of techniques like SMOTE to address dataset imbalances were carried out.
